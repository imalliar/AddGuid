# Add Guid
 Adds guid after file name to all files of a folder
 So if a file named a1.jpg after running its name will be a1-9c25ed1f54ef43023e065015641a41e1.jpg
That way is a very easy way to obfuscate files before uploading to a web site.
It's the easiest way of hidding files from the public and allow only authorized user to download files (through a link).
The initial file name is preserved
